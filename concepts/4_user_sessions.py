# Sessions are essential for creating user-specific experiences, such as maintaining login states or remembering user preferences.

# Lesson Goals
# Understand Sessions and Cookies
# Learn to Set Up Flask Sessions
# Use Sessions to Track User Logins
# Practice Clearing Session Data

# Sessions are used to store information for each user across multiple requests. 
# Flask sessions are stored on the client side as a cookie, and 
# Flask encrypts session data to ensure security.

# Example: If a user logs in, a session can store their login status so they donâ€™t have to log in again on every page.
